# ApproximateComputations.jl

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/NTimmons/ApproximateComputations.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/NTimmons/ApproximateComputations.jl)

Generate new functions which approximate 'sin' in the range 0.001 to pi/2 

```
using ApproximateComputations
newFunctionsAndInformation = GenerateAllApproximationFunctions(sin, 0.001, 1.57)
```

Filter the generated functions to the fastest executing function within our error constraint:
```
a = GetFastestAcceptable(newFunctionsAndInformation, meanErrorLimit=0.00000001)
println(GetFunctionName(a))  # -> returns sin_PolyLet9_Float64bit
```

Store the function for use:
```
approxsin = a.generatedFunction
```

Compare to accurate function:
```
approxResult = approxsin(1.0) # -> Approximation{Float64}(0.8414709848311571)
realResult = sin(1.0)   # -> {Float64} (0.8414709848078965)
```

Approximated functions return a type wrapped in Approximation.
This is to prevent unintentional mixing of approximate space data with high precision data.
To convert from an approximation to the original type we use Get(x)

```
x = Get(approxResult) # -> {Float64} (0.8414709848311571)
```


To be able to produce and select an appropriate approximation the package also contains graphing functions to show the behaviours of the different functions generated by 'GenerateAllApproximationFunctions' as well as filtering functions select only the functions which match constraints on error, runtime or internal type precision.
